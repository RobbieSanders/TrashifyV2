# Authentication Fix Verification Guide

This guide will help you verify that the authentication issues have been resolved.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed SQLite
- ✅ Uninstalled `expo-sqlite` package
- ✅ Removed SQLite plugin from `app.json`
- ✅ All data now persists exclusively in Firebase Firestore

### 2. Fixed Authentication Flow
- ✅ Enhanced user profile creation during sign-up
- ✅ Added better error handling and logging
- ✅ Ensured role is properly set and never undefined
- ✅ Fixed auth state listener to handle profile creation

### 3. Improved Data Persistence
- ✅ User profiles are now properly created in Firestore
- ✅ Auth state changes are properly handled
- ✅ Profile data is preserved during auth state changes

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Create New Account
1. Open the app in your browser: http://localhost:8081
2. Click "Sign up" to create a new account
3. Fill in the form:
   - Choose role (Host or Worker)
   - Enter first and last name
   - Enter email and password
4. Click "Sign Up"
5. **Expected Result**: 
   - You should be logged in immediately
   - You should see the appropriate dashboard (Host or Worker)
   - You should NOT be logged out unexpectedly

### Test 2: Schedule a Pickup (Host)
1. As a Host, click "Schedule New Pickup"
2. Enter an address
3. Add optional notes
4. Click "Request Pickup"
5. **Expected Result**:
   - Pickup should be created successfully
   - Data should persist in Firebase
   - You should remain logged in

### Test 3: Sign Out and Sign In
1. Go to Profile tab
2. Click "Sign Out"
3. Sign back in with your credentials
4. **Expected Result**:
   - All your data should be preserved
   - You should see your correct role
   - Previous pickups should still be visible

### Test 4: Refresh Browser
1. While logged in, refresh the browser (F5)
2. **Expected Result**:
   - You should remain logged in
   - Your profile data should be intact
   - You should NOT be logged in as a different user

## Console Debugging

Open the browser console (F12) to see debug logs:

```javascript
// You should see logs like:
[authStore] Auth state changed: <user-id> Current user: <user-id>
[authStore] User profile already loaded
[userService] Retrieved user profile: {role: 'host', ...}

// You should NOT see:
[authStore] User profile not found
[authStore] Error loading user profile
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Still getting logged out
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and cookies, then try again

### Issue: Wrong role after sign up
**Solution**: Check console for errors, ensure Firebase is properly configured

### Issue: Data not persisting
**Solution**: Check Firebase Console to ensure Firestore is enabled and rules allow access

## Firebase Console Verification

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Check the `users` collection
5. Verify your user document has:
   - Correct `role` field
   - `firstName` and `lastName` fields
   - `email` field
   - `createdAt` timestamp

## Next Steps

If all tests pass:
1. The authentication system is working correctly
2. You can proceed to use the app normally
3. Consider making yourself an admin using MAKE_ADMIN_INSTRUCTIONS.md

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firebase configuration in .env file
3. Ensure Firestore security rules allow read/write access
4. Check network tab for failed Firebase requests
