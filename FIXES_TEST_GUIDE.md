# Trashify Fixes Test Guide

This guide will help you test the fixes implemented for the reported issues.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Cross-platform synchronization** - Pickups created on web are now visible on mobile
2. **Confirmation screen** - Added confirmation modal when pickup is created
3. **Profile fields saving** - Fixed firstName, lastName, and phone field persistence
4. **TypeScript errors** - Fixed User type issues
5. **Text rendering error** - Investigation ongoing (React Fabric internal issue)

## Test Steps

### 1. Test Cross-Platform Synchronization

**On Web:**
1. Sign in as a host user
2. Click "Schedule New Pickup"
3. Enter an address (e.g., "123 Main St, Tampa, FL")
4. Click "Request Pickup"
5. Note the confirmation screen appears
6. Note the job ID shown

**On Mobile:**
1. Sign in with the same host account
2. Verify you can see the pickup created on web
3. Check that all details match (address, status, etc.)

**Approval Flow (if needed):**
- Jobs can be created with `needsApproval: true` to require approval
- Currently set to `false` for immediate availability

### 2. Test Confirmation Screen

1. As a host, create a new pickup
2. Verify the confirmation modal appears with:
   - Green checkmark icon
   - "Pickup Requested!" title
   - Success message
   - Options to "Track Pickup" or "Done"
3. Click "Track Pickup" to verify navigation to tracking screen
4. Create another pickup and click "Done" to close modal

### 3. Test Profile Fields Saving

1. Navigate to Profile screen (person icon in header)
2. Enter/update:
   - First Name
   - Last Name  
   - Phone Number
3. Click "Save Changes"
4. Verify success alert appears
5. Navigate away and come back
6. Verify fields are still populated with saved values

### 4. Test Worker Flow

**As Worker:**
1. Sign in as a worker
2. View available jobs on the map
3. Accept a job
4. Verify worker location updates (on web, simulated movement)
5. Complete the job
6. Check that host receives notification

### 5. Map Visualization

**Host View:**
1. Create a pickup
2. Navigate to Track screen
3. Verify map shows:
   - Pickup location marker
   - Worker location (when assigned)
   - Status overlay with real-time updates

**Worker View:**
1. Sign in as worker
2. Verify map shows:
   - All open jobs as markers
   - Your current location (on mobile)
   - Accepted job details

## Known Issues

### Text Rendering Error
The "Text strings must be rendered within a <Text> component" warning appears to be a React Native Fabric internal issue. The app code has been reviewed and all text is properly wrapped. This may be related to third-party components or React Native internals.

**Workaround:** The warning doesn't affect functionality and can be ignored for now.

## Database Schema

The local SQLite database now includes:
- `first_name` field in users table
- `last_name` field in users table  
- `phone` field in users table

These fields are properly migrated for existing databases.

## Firebase Integration

Jobs are synchronized through Firestore when configured:
- Real-time updates across all devices
- Automatic fallback to local storage if Firebase is not configured
- Jobs collection stores all pickup requests
- Worker location updates in real-time

## Testing Accounts

Default test accounts (if seeded):
- Email: `host` / Password: `Password` (Host role)
- Email: `worker` / Password: `Password` (Worker role)
- Email: `admin` / Password: `Password` (Admin role)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Pickups created on web appear on mobile
- [ ] Pickups created on mobile appear on web
- [ ] Confirmation modal shows after creating pickup
- [ ] Profile fields (firstName, lastName, phone) save correctly
- [ ] Profile fields persist after app restart
- [ ] Worker can see and accept jobs
- [ ] Host can track worker location
- [ ] Map shows correct markers and routes
- [ ] Notifications work for job updates
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in console

## Additional Notes

1. **Cross-platform IDs**: User IDs are now generated consistently based on email hash to ensure the same user has the same ID across platforms.

2. **Real-time Updates**: Firestore subscriptions provide real-time updates. Changes made on one device appear immediately on others.

3. **Location Tracking**: 
   - Mobile: Uses real GPS location
   - Web: Simulates movement for testing

4. **Approval Flow**: Currently disabled (`needsApproval: false`). Can be enabled by setting to `true` in the createJobFS call.

## Support

If you encounter any issues during testing:
1. Check the console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Firebase configuration in `.env` file
3. Ensure you're using the same account across platforms
4. Clear app data/cache if experiencing persistent issues
