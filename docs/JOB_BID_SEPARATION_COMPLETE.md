# Cleaning Jobs and Team Recruitment Separation - Complete

## Summary of Changes

We have successfully separated the cleaning job system from the team recruitment bidding system as requested. Here's what has been implemented:

### 1. **Clear Separation of Concepts**

#### **Cleaning Jobs** (Direct Assignment)
- Actual cleaning work assignments for existing team members
- No bidding involved - hosts directly assign jobs to their team
- Each job has a unique ID (Firestore document ID)
- Status: scheduled, assigned, in-progress, completed, cancelled

#### **Team Recruitment** (Bidding System)
- Used ONLY for recruiting new cleaners to join the host's team
- Cleaners bid to join teams, NOT for specific jobs
- Once accepted, cleaners become team members
- Team members can then be assigned cleaning jobs directly

### 2. **Updated Components**

#### **SearchCleanersScreen.tsx** (for Hosts)
- Renamed from "Post Cleaning Jobs" to "Search for a Cleaner"
- Hosts post recruitment ads with property information
- Can select existing properties or add new ones with:
  - Address, bedrooms, beds, bathrooms
  - Unit size with "I don't know" option
  - Property label/name
  - Notes about what they're looking for
- Services needed selection
- Review and accept cleaner applications

#### **CleanerBiddingScreen.tsx** (for Cleaners)
- Renamed to "Join Cleaning Teams"
- Shows recruitment posts from hosts looking for team members
- Displays property information cleaners will be cleaning
- Clear "JOIN TEAM" badges
- "Apply to Join Team" instead of job-specific bidding
- Shows that it's for "Regular work"

#### **cleaningJobsService.ts**
- Removed all bidding logic from cleaning jobs
- Jobs are now direct assignments only
- Added functions for:
  - Creating cleaning jobs with unique IDs
  - Assigning jobs to team members
  - Updating job status
  - Deleting jobs
- Proper role-based filtering (hosts see their jobs, cleaners see assigned jobs)

#### **cleanerRecruitmentService.ts**
- Handles all team recruitment and bidding
- When a bid is accepted, the cleaner is automatically added to the host's team
- Separate from cleaning job operations

#### **types.ts**
- `CleaningJob`: Direct work assignments (no bidding fields)
- `CleanerRecruitment`: Team recruitment posts with property arrays
- `CleanerBid`: Applications to join teams
- `TeamMember`: Cleaners who have joined through recruitment

### 3. **User Flow**

#### **Host Flow**
1. Go to "Search for a Cleaner" to recruit team members
2. Post recruitment with property information
3. Review applications from cleaners
4. Accept cleaners to join their team
5. Assign cleaning jobs directly to team members (no bidding)

#### **Cleaner Flow**
1. Browse "Join Cleaning Teams" for opportunities
2. View properties they would be cleaning
3. Submit application with hourly rate and availability
4. Once accepted, become a team member
5. Receive direct job assignments from the host

### 4. **Key Benefits**

- **Clear separation**: No confusion between recruiting and job assignment
- **Efficient workflow**: Direct assignment for actual work
- **Proper team building**: Recruitment system for finding cleaners
- **Unique IDs**: Each job has a Firestore document ID for easy tracking
- **Property-based recruitment**: Cleaners know what they'll be cleaning

## Firebase Indexes Needed

Add these composite indexes to Firestore:

```
Collection: cleanerRecruitments
- hostId (Ascending)
- status (Ascending)
- createdAt (Descending)

Collection: cleanerRecruitments/[documentId]/bids
- cleanerId (Ascending)
- status (Ascending)
- bidDate (Descending)

Collection: cleaningJobs
- hostId (Ascending)
- status (Ascending)
- preferredDate (Descending)

Collection: cleaningJobs
- assignedCleanerId (Ascending)
- status (Ascending)
- preferredDate (Descending)
```

## Database Structure

### cleanerRecruitments Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  hostId: "host-user-id",
  hostName: "Host Name",
  properties: [
    {
      address: "123 Main St",
      bedrooms: 3,
      bathrooms: 2,
      unitSize: 1500,
      label: "Beach House"
    }
  ],
  servicesNeeded: ["Standard Cleaning", "Deep Cleaning"],
  notes: "Looking for reliable cleaner",
  status: "open",
  createdAt: 1234567890,
  bids: [] // Subcollection
}
```

### cleaningJobs Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated", // Unique job ID
  hostId: "host-user-id",
  hostName: "Host Name",
  address: "123 Main St",
  preferredDate: "2024-01-15",
  preferredTime: "10:00 AM",
  assignedCleanerId: "cleaner-user-id",
  assignedCleanerName: "Cleaner Name",
  status: "assigned",
  cleaningType: "standard",
  notes: "Please focus on bathrooms",
  createdAt: "2024-01-10T10:00:00Z",
  assignedAt: "2024-01-11T14:00:00Z"
}
```

## Migration Notes

If you have existing data:

1. **Cleaning Jobs**: Remove any bidding-related fields (bids, bidCount, etc.)
2. **Create Recruitment Posts**: For hosts who need cleaners
3. **Update Team Members**: Ensure myTeam array in user profiles is populated
4. **Job IDs**: All jobs now use Firestore document IDs

## Next Steps

1. Test the complete flow with both host and cleaner accounts
2. Create the Firebase composite indexes
3. Consider adding:
   - Job scheduling calendar for assigned cleaners
   - Team management screen for hosts
   - Performance tracking for team members
   - Automated job assignment based on availability

The system is now properly separated with cleaning jobs being direct assignments and the bidding system used exclusively for team recruitment.
