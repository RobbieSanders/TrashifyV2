# Property Cleanup Tool - Implementation Complete

## Issue Description
A property ("2810 N Florida Ave, Tampa, FL 33602") was deleted from the database but orphaned data remained in various collections:
- Cleaning jobs still referenced the deleted property
- Pickup jobs still scheduled for the address
- Team members showing "Unknown property" in their primary properties
- Cleaner recruitment posts still listing the deleted property

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Property Deletion Logic
Updated `src/stores/accountsStore.ts` to implement cascade deletion:
- When a property is deleted, all related data is now automatically cleaned up
- Prevents future orphaned data issues

### 2. Property Cleanup Tool
Created `src/components/PropertyCleanupTool.tsx`:
- Interactive tool to clean up existing orphaned data
- Searches for multiple address variations
- Provides detailed cleanup results
- Handles:
  - Cleaning jobs deletion
  - Pickup jobs deletion
  - Cleaner recruitment posts update/deletion
  - Team member property arrays cleanup

### 3. Admin Dashboard Integration
Added the cleanup tool to the Admin Dashboard:
- New "Tools" tab in the admin interface
- Easy access for administrators to run cleanup operations
- Visual feedback on cleanup progress and results

## How to Use

### For Administrators:
1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard
2. Click on the "Tools" tab
3. Find the "Property Data Cleanup Tool"
4. Click "Run Cleanup" to remove orphaned data for the deleted property
5. Review the cleanup results showing what was cleaned

### What Gets Cleaned:
- **Cleaning Jobs**: All future cleaning jobs for the deleted property address
- **Pickup Jobs**: All scheduled pickups for the deleted property
- **Recruitment Posts**: Updates posts to remove the property, deletes posts with no remaining properties
- **Team Members**: Removes the deleted property from team members' primary properties arrays

## Files Modified
1. `src/stores/accountsStore.ts` - Enhanced with cascade deletion
2. `src/components/PropertyCleanupTool.tsx` - New cleanup tool component
3. `src/screens/admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Added Tools tab with cleanup tool

## Testing the Fix
1. Run the cleanup tool from the Admin Dashboard
2. Check that all orphaned references are removed
3. Verify team members no longer show "Unknown property"
4. Confirm no cleaning/pickup jobs remain for the deleted address
5. Test future property deletions to ensure cascade deletion works

## Technical Details
- Uses Firestore queries to find all documents referencing the deleted property
- Handles multiple address format variations
- Provides real-time feedback during cleanup process
- Properly handles errors and edge cases
- Maintains data integrity throughout the cleanup process

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a scheduled cleanup job to automatically detect and remove orphaned data
- Add ability to specify custom property addresses for cleanup
- Implement batch operations for better performance with large datasets
- Add logging/audit trail for cleanup operations

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - The property cleanup tool has been successfully implemented and integrated into the admin dashboard. The orphaned data for "2810 N Florida Ave, Tampa, FL 33602" can now be cleaned up using the tool.
