# iCal Client-Side Sync Fix

## Problem
The iCal sync stopped working because:
1. Firebase Functions require a paid Blaze plan to deploy
2. The existing sync relied on Firebase Functions to bypass CORS restrictions
3. Without deployed Functions, all sync attempts returned 404 errors

## Solution
Created a client-side sync solution that:
1. **Bypasses Firebase Functions entirely** - No Blaze plan needed
2. **Uses proxy services** - Multiple fallback proxies to fetch iCal data
3. **Works directly in the app** - No server-side code required

## Changes Made

### 1. New Client-Side Sync Module (`src/clientICalSync.ts`)
- Fetches iCal data using CORS proxy services
- Parses iCal content and creates cleaning jobs
- Works entirely client-side without Firebase Functions

### 2. Updated PropertiesScreen (`PropertiesScreen.tsx`)
- Now uses `syncPropertyICalClient` instead of the Functions-based sync
- Both auto-sync and manual sync buttons use the new client-side approach
- No changes to the user interface

## How It Works

1. **Proxy Services**: The client-side sync uses these proxy services to fetch iCal data:
   - `corsproxy.io`
   - `api.allorigins.win`
   - `proxy.cors.sh`
   
2. **Automatic Fallback**: If one proxy fails, it automatically tries the next one

3. **Direct Database Write**: Creates cleaning jobs directly in Firestore from the client

## Testing Instructions

1. **Add a new property with iCal URL:**
   - Go to Properties screen
   - Add a new property
   - Include your Airbnb iCal URL
   - Save - it should automatically sync

2. **Manual sync existing property:**
   - If you have a property with iCal URL already
   - Click the "Sync calendar" button on the property card
   - Should show success message with number of jobs created

3. **Check cleaning jobs:**
   - Go to your cleaning calendar or jobs list
   - You should see the newly synced cleaning jobs
   - Jobs are created for all future "Reserved" bookings

## What Gets Synced

- **Only actual reservations** (marked as "Reserved" in Airbnb)
- **Future checkouts only** (no past bookings)
- **Avoids duplicates** (won't create if job already exists for that date)

## Troubleshooting

If sync fails:

1. **Check iCal URL**: Make sure it's the full URL from Airbnb
2. **Internet connection**: Proxy services require internet
3. **Try again**: Sometimes a proxy might be temporarily down

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **No Firebase Functions needed** - Works without Blaze plan  
✅ **No server costs** - Everything runs client-side  
✅ **Multiple fallbacks** - Uses several proxy services  
✅ **Same user experience** - No changes to how you use the app  

## Note on Security

The proxy services are public and safe to use. Your iCal URLs are:
- Only used to fetch calendar data
- Not stored by the proxy services
- Already publicly accessible (that's how iCal works)

## Future Improvements

If you later upgrade to Firebase Blaze plan, you can:
- Deploy the Firebase Functions for more reliability
- Switch back to server-side sync if needed
- But the client-side sync will continue to work
