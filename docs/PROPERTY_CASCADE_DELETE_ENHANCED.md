# Property Cascade Deletion - Enhanced Implementation

## Problem Solved
When properties were deleted, orphaned data remained throughout the system:
- Cleaning jobs still existed for deleted properties
- Team members showed "Unknown property" references  
- Next Services (trash pickup and cleaning) still displayed deleted properties
- Bids remained for jobs at deleted properties
- Recruitment posts contained deleted property references

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the `removeProperty` function in `src/stores/accountsStore.ts` to perform comprehensive cascade deletion automatically when a property is deleted.

## What Gets Cleaned Up

### 1. Cleaning Jobs
- **ALL** cleaning jobs for the deleted property address are removed
- Not limited to future jobs - prevents any orphaned historical data
- Job IDs are collected for bid cleanup

### 2. Bids
- All bids related to deleted cleaning jobs are removed
- Prevents orphaned bid references

### 3. Team Members
- Removes property from `assignedProperties` array
- Removes property from `properties` array
- Clears `address` field if it matches deleted property
- Updates are done individually to preserve other data

### 4. Recruitment Posts
- Removes deleted property from recruitment `properties` array
- Deletes entire recruitment if no properties remain
- Updates recruitment if other properties exist

### 5. Pickup Jobs
- **ALL** pickup jobs for the deleted property address are removed
- Includes both past and future pickup jobs

### 6. Worker History
- Marks entries with "(deleted property)" suffix
- Adds `property_deleted: true` flag
- Preserves historical data while indicating property no longer exists

## Implementation Details

### Batch Operations
- Uses Firestore batch writes for efficient deletion
- Groups multiple delete operations together
- Single commit for all deletions

### Comprehensive Logging
```javascript
console.log(`[accountsStore] Starting cascade deletion for property: ${propertyId}, address: ${address}`);
console.log(`[accountsStore] Found ${snapshot.size} cleaning jobs to delete`);
console.log(`[accountsStore] Cascade deletion complete. Total items deleted: ${totalDeleted}`);
```

### Error Handling
- Each cleanup section has its own try/catch
- Errors are logged but don't stop other cleanups
- Main error is re-thrown for UI handling

## Testing

### Test Script
Use `src/scripts/test/testPropertyCascadeDeletion.js` to verify cascade deletion:

```bash
# Check what data exists for a property
node src/scripts/test/testPropertyCascadeDeletion.js "2810 N Florida Ave, Tampa, FL 33602"

# Delete the property through the app

# Run again to verify all data was cleaned up
node src/scripts/test/testPropertyCascadeDeletion.js "2810 N Florida Ave, Tampa, FL 33602"
```

### What the Test Checks
1. Cleaning jobs at the address
2. Bids for those jobs
3. Pickup jobs at the address
4. Team member property references
5. Recruitment post property references
6. Worker history entries

## Benefits

### Automatic Cleanup
- No manual intervention required
- Prevents data inconsistencies
- Maintains database integrity

### Complete Coverage
- Handles all known data relationships
- Cleans both current and historical data
- Updates or removes partial references

### Performance
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Parallel processing where possible
- Immediate local state update for UI responsiveness

## Usage

When a property is deleted through the app:
1. The enhanced `removeProperty` function is called
2. Property document is deleted immediately
3. Local state updates for immediate UI feedback
4. Background cascade deletion runs
5. All related data is cleaned up automatically

## Code Location
- Main implementation: `src/stores/accountsStore.ts` - `removeProperty` function
- Test script: `src/scripts/test/testPropertyCascadeDeletion.js`

## Future Considerations

### Additional Collections
If new collections reference properties, add cleanup logic:
```javascript
// Example for new collection
const newCollectionRef = collection(db, 'newCollection');
const newQuery = query(newCollectionRef, where('propertyAddress', '==', address));
const newSnapshot = await getDocs(newQuery);
newSnapshot.docs.forEach(doc => batch.delete(doc.ref));
```

### Cloud Functions Alternative
For larger scale operations, consider moving cascade deletion to a Cloud Function:
- Triggered by property document deletion
- Runs server-side for reliability
- Can handle timeouts and retries

## Reliability
The cascade deletion is now automatic and comprehensive, ensuring that when a property is deleted, ALL related data is properly cleaned up. This eliminates the "orphaned data" problem and makes the admin tool reliable for property management.
