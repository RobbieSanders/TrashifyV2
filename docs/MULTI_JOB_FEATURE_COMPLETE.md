# Multi-Job Acceptance Feature - Implementation Complete

## Overview
The multi-job acceptance feature has been successfully implemented, allowing workers to accept and manage multiple jobs simultaneously with priority-based queue management.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Worker Can Accept Multiple Jobs ✅
- Workers can now accept multiple jobs while having active jobs
- The "Available Jobs" section remains visible even when worker has active jobs
- Jobs are queued based on acceptance order

### 2. Priority Assignment ✅
- Each job gets a `workerPriority` number based on acceptance order
- First accepted job = Priority #1
- Second accepted job = Priority #2, etc.
- Priority numbers are stored in Firebase and synced across devices

### 3. Visual Priority Indicators on Map ✅
**Location:** `App.tsx` - WorkerHomeScreen component
- Priority numbers displayed on polylines for each job
- Current job (priority #1) has solid blue line
- Queued jobs have dashed gray lines
- Priority badge shows as a numbered circle at the midpoint of each polyline

### 4. Host Queue Position Display ✅
**Location:** `App.tsx` - TrackScreen component
- Hosts see their position in the worker's queue
- Display shows "You're #2 in queue" (or appropriate number)
- Informational message: "The worker has X pickup(s) to complete before yours"

### 5. Worker Status Messages for Hosts ✅
**When host is not first in queue:**
- Shows "Worker is completing another job"
- Displays estimated start time based on 15 minutes per job calculation
- Blue hourglass icon indicates waiting status

**When host becomes next:**
- Shows "Worker assigned" or "Worker on the way"
- Displays estimated arrival time
- Real-time tracking when job is in progress

### 6. Job Queue Management ✅
**Worker Dashboard shows:**
- Current/Next Job card with priority badge
- Job Queue section listing all waiting jobs
- Each queued job shows:
  - Priority number
  - Address
  - Estimated start time

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates
**File:** `src/types.ts`
```typescript
interface Job {
  // ... existing fields
  workerPriority?: number;      // Job priority in worker's queue
  estimatedStartTime?: string;  // Estimated time when worker will start
}
```

### Priority Assignment Logic
**File:** `src/jobsService.ts`
- When accepting a job, system queries existing active jobs for the worker
- Priority = number of existing active jobs + 1
- Estimated start time = current time + (priority - 1) * 15 minutes

### Priority Adjustment on Completion
- When a job is completed, all remaining jobs' priorities are decremented
- Estimated start times are recalculated

## User Experience Flow

### Worker Flow:
1. Worker sees available jobs within their radius
2. Can accept multiple jobs even with active jobs
3. Jobs are automatically queued with priority numbers
4. Worker completes jobs in order (can start next job when ready)
5. Queue automatically updates as jobs are completed

### Host Flow:
1. Host creates a pickup request
2. When worker accepts, host sees their queue position
3. If not first, sees "Worker is completing another job"
4. Gets estimated start time
5. When becoming next, sees real-time tracking
