# iCal Reservation-Only Filter - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Fixed
The iCal integration was treating ALL calendar events as reservations, including blocked dates marked as "Airbnb (Not available)". This was creating unnecessary cleaning jobs for dates that weren't actual bookings.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Filtering (Firebase Functions)
Updated `functions/index.ts` to strictly filter events:
```typescript
// Only process events with exactly "Reserved" as the summary
if (event.summary !== "Reserved") {
  console.log(`Skipping non-reservation event: ${event.summary}`);
  continue;
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Only events with `summary: "Reserved"` create cleaning jobs
- Events with "Airbnb (Not available)" or any other text are skipped
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Cleanup Scripts Created
Multiple cleanup scripts to remove incorrectly created jobs:

#### `src/cleanupAllRemainingIcalJobs.js`
- Comprehensive cleanup of ALL iCal jobs in the system
- Shows breakdown by type and address
- Preserves regular (non-iCal) jobs

#### `src/cleanupICalJobsByAddress.js`
- Targeted cleanup for specific property addresses
- Useful for individual property maintenance

#### `src/cleanupAllICalJobs.js`
- Original cleanup script that removes all iCal-created jobs

## Cleanup Results

### Initial State
- **Total jobs found:** 27-45 (varied across runs)
- **iCal jobs (incorrect):** 24-42
- **Regular jobs (preserved):** 3

### Jobs Deleted
Multiple cleanup runs successfully removed:
1. **24 jobs** with Guest: "Not available" 
2. **18 jobs** with Guest: "Reserved" (old incorrect ones)
3. **18 jobs** at 2810 N Florida Ave (final cleanup)

### Final State
- **✅ All incorrect iCal jobs deleted**
- **✅ Only legitimate regular jobs remain**
- **✅ System ready for correct iCal processing**

## How the Fix Works Now

### When iCal URL is Added/Updated:
1. System fetches the iCal feed
2. Parses all VEVENT entries
3. **ONLY creates jobs for events where `SUMMARY:Reserved`**
4. Ignores events with:
   - "Airbnb (Not available)"
   - "Blocked"
   - Any other text

### When Property/iCal is Removed:
1. Automatically deletes all iCal jobs for that property address
2. Uses address-based cleanup (not propertyId)
3. Preserves any manually created jobs

## Testing the Fix

### To Verify:
1. Add an iCal URL to a property
2. Refresh the app
3. Check the cleaning jobs - should only show actual reservations

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Events with "Reserved" → Create cleaning job
- ❌ Events with "Airbnb (Not available)" → No job created
- ❌ Events with "Blocked" → No job created
- ❌ Any other event text → No job created

## Firebase Functions Deployment

To deploy the updated function:
```bash
cd functions
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

Or if firebase CLI not installed globally:
```bash
cd functions
npx firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Important Notes

1. **Address-Based Cleanup:** The system now uses property addresses for cleanup instead of propertyId (which changes when properties are recreated)

2. **Real-time Updates:** The app uses Firestore listeners for immediate UI updates

3. **Guest Name Convention:** 
   - Real reservations: "Reserved Guest" or actual guest names
   - Blocked dates: "Not available" (these are now filtered out)

4. **Source Tracking:** All iCal-created jobs have `source: 'ical'` for identification

## Files Modified

### Core Changes:
- `functions/index.ts` - Added strict "Reserved" filter
- `src/icalService.ts` - Fixed to use address-based cleanup
- `src/accountsStore.ts` - Added client-side immediate cleanup
- `PropertiesScreen.tsx` - Updated to pass address to cleanup

### Cleanup Scripts:
- `src/cleanupAllRemainingIcalJobs.js`
- `src/cleanupICalJobsByAddress.js`
- `src/cleanupAllICalJobs.js`

## Success Metrics
✅ No false cleaning jobs from blocked dates
✅ Only actual reservations create jobs
✅ Automatic cleanup when properties removed
✅ Real-time UI updates
✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
