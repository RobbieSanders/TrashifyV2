# Auto-Add Cleaner to Team on Bid Acceptance

## Implementation Summary

When a host accepts a cleaner's bid, the cleaner is now automatically added as a primary cleaner to the host's "My Teams" section.

## Changes Made

### Updated: `src/SearchCleanersScreen.tsx`

1. **Imported TeamMember type and getDoc function**
   - Added `TeamMember` to the imports from `./types`
   - Added `getDoc` to Firebase imports

2. **Enhanced `handleAcceptBid` function**
   - After accepting the bid and updating the job status
   - Retrieves the host's current team data from Firestore
   - Checks if the cleaner is already in the team (by userId or name)
   - If not in the team, creates a new TeamMember entry with:
     - Cleaner's ID and name from the bid
     - Role set as 'primary_cleaner'
     - Status set as 'active'
     - Rating and completed jobs from the bid data
   - Updates the host's document with the new team member

## How It Works

1. **Host posts a cleaning job**
   - Creates a job listing in the marketplace

2. **Cleaner places a bid**
   - Bid includes cleaner's name, ID, rating, and completed jobs count

3. **Host accepts the bid**
   - Job status changes to 'accepted'
   - Cleaner is assigned to the job
   - **NEW: Cleaner is automatically added to host's team**

4. **Team Management**
   - Cleaner appears in "My Teams" under "Primary Cleaners"
   - Shows cleaner's name, rating, and completed jobs
   - Host can manage status (active/inactive) or remove if needed

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Have two test accounts:
   - One as a Host (property owner)
   - One as a Cleaner

### Test Steps

1. **As Host:**
   - Navigate to "Search Cleaners" tab
   - Click "Post New Cleaning Job"
   - Fill in the job details and submit

2. **As Cleaner:**
   - Navigate to "Cleaner" tab â†’ "Bids" section
   - Find the posted job
   - Click "Place Bid"
   - Enter bid amount and estimated hours
   - Submit the bid

3. **As Host:**
   - Go back to "Search Cleaners"
   - Find your job with bids
   - Click "View Bids" or click on the job card
   - Click "Accept Bid" on the cleaner's bid

4. **Verify Team Addition:**
   - Navigate to "My Team" tab
   - Check the "Primary Cleaners" section
   - Confirm the cleaner appears with:
     - Their name
     - Active status
     - Rating (if available)
     - Completed jobs count (if available)

## Benefits

1. **Streamlined Workflow**
   - No manual team addition required
   - Automatic team building through successful bids

2. **Trust Building**
   - Hosts build their team with cleaners they've already vetted through the bidding process

3. **Cleaner History**
   - Hosts maintain a record of all cleaners they've worked with
   - Can easily rehire cleaners for future jobs

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Checks if cleaner is already in team before adding
   - Prevents duplicate entries

2. **Data Preservation**
   - Preserves cleaner's rating and job history from bid
   - Maintains all existing team members

3. **Error Handling**
   - Gracefully handles database errors
   - Shows appropriate error messages to user

## Future Enhancements

1. **Team Member Updates**
   - Update rating and completed jobs count after each job completion

2. **Preferred Cleaners**
   - Allow hosts to mark certain cleaners as "preferred"
   - Send direct job invitations to preferred cleaners

3. **Team Analytics**
   - Show performance metrics for team members
   - Track job completion rates and customer satisfaction

## Success Message

When a bid is accepted, the host now sees:
"You have accepted [Cleaner Name]'s bid for $[Amount]! They have been added to your team."

This confirms both the bid acceptance and the automatic team addition.
