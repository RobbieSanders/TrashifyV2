# Bid System and Profile Update - Complete

## Date: August 26, 2025

## Summary
Successfully updated the bidding system with flat fee pricing, fixed Firebase errors, added bid notifications, and implemented a profile editor for cleaners.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Flat Fee Pricing System
- Changed from hourly rate to flat fee per job pricing
- Updated all displays to show "$/job" instead of "$/hr"
- Modified all relevant interfaces and UI components

### 2. Firebase Error Resolution
- Fixed "Unsupported field value: undefined" errors
- Implemented dynamic object building to exclude undefined fields
- Added proper defaults for rating (0) and completedJobs (0)
- Only includes optional fields when they have actual values

### 3. Notifications System
**Location:** `src/cleanerRecruitmentService.ts`
- Notifications are sent when a cleaner submits a bid
- Host receives: "New bid received from [name] for [X] properties - $[amount]/job"
- All admins receive: "New bid: [name] bid on [host]'s recruitment - $[amount]/job"
- Uses the existing `notificationsStore` for real-time notifications

### 4. Cleaner Profile Editor
**Location:** `src/CleanerBiddingScreen.tsx`
- Added profile button (person icon) in the header
- Opens a modal where cleaners can edit:
  - First Name (required)
  - Last Name (required)
  - Phone Number (optional)
- Updates both Firebase and local auth store
- Name is now properly saved and displayed when accepting bids

## Files Modified
1. `src/types.ts` - Changed CleanerBid interface to use flatFee
2. `src/cleanerRecruitmentService.ts` - Added notifications and fixed undefined handling
3. `src/CleanerBiddingScreen.tsx` - Added profile editor and updated to flat fee
4. `src/SearchCleanersScreen.tsx` - Updated display to show flat fee

## Testing Instructions

### Test Notifications:
1. As a cleaner, submit a bid on a recruitment post
2. Log in as the host - should see notification about new bid
3. Log in as admin - should also see notification about the bid

### Test Profile Saving:
1. As a cleaner, click the profile icon in the header
2. Enter first name, last name, and optionally phone number
3. Save the profile
4. Submit a bid - should show your saved name
5. When host accepts bid, cleaner's name should display correctly (not null)

### Test Flat Fee:
1. Submit a bid with flat fee amount
2. View as host - should see "$X/job" format
3. View bid history as cleaner - should show "$X/job" format

## Benefits
