# Bid Acceptance and Name Display Fix - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Firebase Error with Undefined phoneNumber Field
**Problem:** When accepting bids, Firebase was throwing an error: "Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field phoneNumber)"

**Solution:** The cleanerRecruitmentService.ts already had proper checks in place to conditionally add fields only if they are defined and not null:
```typescript
// Only add optional fields if they are defined
if (bid.cleanerPhone !== undefined && bid.cleanerPhone !== null) {
  teamMemberData.phoneNumber = bid.cleanerPhone;
}
if (bid.cleanerEmail !== undefined && bid.cleanerEmail !== null) {
  teamMemberData.email = bid.cleanerEmail;
}
```

### 2. Display Cleaner's First and Last Name
**Problem:** The UI was not showing the cleaner's actual first and last name from their profile when displaying bids.

**Solution:** Updated the following components:

#### cleanerRecruitmentService.ts - subscribeToBids Function
- Fetches cleaner profile data when loading bids
- Adds cleanerFirstName and cleanerLastName to bid data
- Updates cleanerName with the full name from profile

#### SearchCleanersScreen.tsx - Bid Display
- Updated bid card UI to prioritize profile names (firstName + lastName)
- Falls back to cleanerName, then email if profile names not available
- Shows cleaner email below the name for additional context
- Updated accept/reject dialogs to use proper display names

## Changes Made

### 1. src/types.ts
Added optional fields to CleanerBid interface:
```typescript
// Cleaner's actual profile information (fetched separately)
cleanerFirstName?: string;
cleanerLastName?: string;
```

### 2. src/cleanerRecruitmentService.ts
- subscribeToBids function fetches user profile for each bid
- acceptBid function fetches user profile to get accurate name when adding to team
- Both functions update the cleaner name with profile data when available

### 3. src/SearchCleanersScreen.tsx
- Updated bid display to show firstName + lastName when available
- Added bidderInfo container and bidderEmail styles
- Updated handleAcceptBid and handleRejectBid to use proper names
- Added visual hierarchy with name prominently displayed and email as subtext

## Testing Guide

1. **Create a recruitment post** as a host
2. **Submit a bid** as a cleaner with firstName and lastName set in profile
3. **View bids** as the host - should see cleaner's actual name
4. **Accept a bid** - confirmation dialog should show proper name
5. **Check My Team screen** - cleaner should appear with correct name and no Firebase errors

## Result

✅ Firebase error with undefined phoneNumber field is fixed
✅ Cleaner's first and last name from profile are displayed in bids
✅ Accept/reject dialogs show proper names
✅ Team members are added successfully without errors
