# Team Role Management - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Bid Acceptance Error
**Problem**: Firebase error "Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field phoneNumber)" when accepting bids without phone numbers.

**Solution**: Modified `acceptBid` function to only add optional fields if they are defined and not null.

### 2. Missing Cleaner Names
**Problem**: Not displaying cleaner's actual first and last name from profile when accepting bids.

**Solution**: Added profile fetching to retrieve firstName and lastName from user profiles when accepting bids and displaying bid lists.

### 3. Automatic Role Assignment
**Problem**: Cleaners added through bid acceptance weren't being assigned as primary/secondary appropriately.

**Solution**: 
- First cleaner added to team is automatically set as primary
- Additional cleaners are set as secondary
- Checks existing team members to determine appropriate role

### 4. Team Management UI
**Problem**: MyTeamsScreen was using old data structure and didn't support role management.

**Solution**: 
- Updated MyTeamsScreen to use subcollection for team members
- Added role switching capability for cleaners (tap role icon to switch)
- Prevents workers/trash service from being changed to cleaner roles
- Shows proper role indicators and grouping

## Key Features Implemented

## Files Modified
1. `src/cleanerRecruitmentService.ts` - Fixed undefined fields, added profile fetching, automatic role assignment
2. `src/types.ts` - Added cleanerFirstName and cleanerLastName fields to CleanerBid
3. `src/MyTeamsScreen.tsx` - Complete rewrite to use subcollection and support role management

## Testing Instructions

### Test Bid Acceptance
1. Create a recruitment post as a host
2. Have cleaners submit bids (with and without phone numbers)
3. Accept bids - should work without errors
4. First cleaner should be Primary, others Secondary
5. Verify cleaner names show correctly from profiles

### Test Team Management
1. Go to "My Team" screen
2. View team members grouped by role
3. Tap on cleaner role icons to switch between Primary/Secondary
4. Try tapping on Trash Service role icon - should show info that it can't be changed
5. Add new team members manually
6. Toggle member active/inactive status
7. Remove team members

### Test Edge Cases
- Accept bid from cleaner without phone number
- Accept bid from cleaner without profile firstName/lastName
- Switch roles when you have multiple cleaners
- Try to change trash service role (should be prevented)

## Success Indicators
