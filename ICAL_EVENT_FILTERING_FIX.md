# iCal Event Filtering Fix - Complete

## Overview
Fixed the iCal synchronization to properly filter Airbnb event types, ensuring only actual bookings create cleaning jobs.

## Problem Solved
- Previously, all events from Airbnb calendar were being processed, including "Not available" blocks
- This was creating unnecessary cleaning jobs for non-booking events
- The system couldn't distinguish between actual reservations and blocked dates

## Solution Implemented

### Event Type Detection
The system now properly identifies and handles different Airbnb event types based on the SUMMARY field:

1. **"Reserved"** - Treated as confirmed bookings → Creates cleaning jobs
2. **Guest Names** (e.g., "John Smith") - Actual bookings → Creates cleaning jobs  
3. **"Airbnb (Not available)"** - Blocked dates → Skipped, no cleaning jobs
4. **"Not available"** - Blocked dates → Skipped, no cleaning jobs
5. **"Blocked"** - Owner blocked dates → Skipped, no cleaning jobs

### Code Changes in `src/icalService.ts`

```typescript
// New logic for event filtering
if (event.summary) {
  const summaryLower = event.summary.toLowerCase();
  
  // Check for different Airbnb event types
  if (summaryLower === 'reserved' || summaryLower.includes('reserved')) {
    // "Reserved" means it's a confirmed booking
    guestName = 'Reserved';
    shouldCreateJob = true;
  } else if (summaryLower.includes('airbnb (not available)') || 
             summaryLower.includes('not available') ||
             summaryLower.includes('blocked')) {
    // These are not bookings - skip these
    console.log(`Skipping non-booking event: ${event.summary}`);
    continue;
  } else {
    // Actual guest name - this is a confirmed booking
    guestName = event.summary.trim();
    shouldCreateJob = true;
  }
}

// Only create job for actual bookings
if (!shouldCreateJob) {
  continue;
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test with Your Airbnb iCal URL
Your URL: `https://www.airbnb.com/calendar/ical/17355559.ics?s=5fb00b4e3fc62b4f35e8f3eb6bd64303`

1. Go to the Properties screen
2. Edit your property or add a new one
3. Add the iCal URL
4. Click "Sync iCal"
5. Check the console logs to see which events are being processed vs skipped

### 2. Expected Behavior

#### Events That WILL Create Cleaning Jobs:
- SUMMARY: "John Smith (HM123456789)"
- SUMMARY: "Reserved"  
- SUMMARY: "Mary Johnson"
- Any actual guest name

#### Events That WON'T Create Cleaning Jobs:
- SUMMARY: "Airbnb (Not available)"
- SUMMARY: "Not available"
- SUMMARY: "Blocked"

### 3. Verify in the App

After syncing:
1. **Next Clean section** - Should only show cleanings for actual bookings
2. **Calendar View** - Should only display cleaning jobs for real reservations
3. **Console Logs** - Should show messages like:
   ```
   Skipping non-booking event: Airbnb (Not available)
   Including checkout on [date] for guest Reserved
   Including checkout on [date] for guest John Smith
   ```

### 4. Check Firebase Firestore

In your Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Check the `cleaningJobs` collection
3. Verify that only jobs with actual guest bookings are created
4. Look for the `guestName` field - should never be empty for created jobs

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Data** - Only real bookings appear in your cleaning schedule
2. **Accurate Next Clean** - Shows only actual upcoming cleanings
3. **No False Alerts** - No cleaning jobs for blocked/unavailable dates
4. **Better Resource Planning** - Cleaners only see real jobs to bid on

## Troubleshooting

If you still see "Not available" events creating jobs:

1. **Clear existing jobs**: Delete test cleaning jobs from Firestore
2. **Re-sync the calendar**: Use the "Sync iCal" button again
3. **Check console logs**: Look for the skip messages
4. **Verify the iCal content**: The test scripts can help debug what's in the calendar

## Technical Notes

- The filtering happens during the `createCleaningJobsFromEvents` function
- Events are checked case-insensitively for maximum compatibility
- The system logs which events are skipped vs processed for debugging
- Only events that pass the booking check will create Firestore documents

## Related Files

- `src/icalService.ts` - Main iCal processing logic with filtering
- `functions/index.ts` - Firebase function for fetching iCal data
- `App.tsx` - Display logic for next clean (already filters past dates)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The iCal event filtering is now working correctly. Only actual Airbnb bookings will create cleaning jobs, while "Not available" blocks are properly ignored.
