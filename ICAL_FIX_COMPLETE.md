# iCal Integration Fix - Complete

## Problem Summary
The iCal integration was failing with two main errors:
1. **Network Request Failure**: `TypeError: Network request failed` when fetching iCal data
2. **Firebase Error**: `Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field phoneLastFour)` when syncing to Firebase

## Root Causes
1. **Network Issues**: 
   - CORS restrictions preventing direct fetch from Airbnb URLs
   - No retry logic for failed requests
   - Missing timeout handling

2. **Firebase Field Issues**:
   - Setting `undefined` values directly in Firebase documents (not allowed)
   - Optional fields (`phoneLastFour`, `reservationUrl`) were being set even when undefined

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Network Handling (`src/icalService.ts`)

#### Added Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
```typescript
const maxRetries = 3;
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
  try {
    // Attempt to fetch with timeout
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 30000);
    // ... fetch logic
  } catch (error) {
    // Exponential backoff between retries
    const delay = Math.min(1000 * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1), 5000);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
  }
}
```

#### Added Timeout Handling
- 30-second timeout for Firebase Function calls
- 15-second timeout for direct fetch (development fallback)
- Proper cleanup of timeout handlers

#### Improved Error Messages
- Clear indication of what failed and why
- Helpful guidance for users

### 2. Fixed Firebase Field Handling

#### Conditional Field Assignment
```typescript
// Only add optional fields if they have values
if (event.reservationUrl) {
  cleaningJob.reservationUrl = event.reservationUrl;
}

if (event.phoneLastFour) {
  cleaningJob.phoneLastFour = event.phoneLastFour;
}
```

This prevents `undefined` values from being set in Firebase, which causes the "Unsupported field value" error.

### 3. Firebase Function Updates (`functions/index.ts`)
- Added same conditional field logic to Firebase Functions
- Improved error handling and logging
- Enhanced iCal parsing for Airbnb-specific data

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test with Your Airbnb iCal URL
1. Go to the Properties screen in the app
2. Add or edit a property
3. Enter your Airbnb iCal URL:
   ```
   https://www.airbnb.com/calendar/ical/17355559.ics?s=5fb00b4e3fc62b4f35e8f3eb6bd64303
   ```
4. Save the property
5. The sync should now work without errors

### 2. Verify Cleaning Jobs Creation
After syncing, check the Cleaning Calendar to see:
- New cleaning jobs created for checkout dates
- Guest information extracted (if available)
- Check-in/check-out dates properly set

### 3. Monitor Console for Success
Look for these success messages in the console:
- `Fetching iCal from: [URL] (attempt 1/3)`
- `iCal content received, parsing events...`
- `Parsed X events from iCal`
- `Created cleaning job for [date]`

## What the Fix Handles

### Network Resilience
✅ Retries failed requests up to 3 times  
✅ Uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming servers  
✅ Handles timeouts gracefully  
✅ Falls back to direct fetch in development if Firebase Function fails  

### Data Validation
✅ Only sets fields with actual values (no undefined)  
✅ Properly parses Airbnb DESCRIPTION fields  
✅ Extracts reservation URLs when present  
✅ Extracts phone last 4 digits when available  

### Error Recovery
✅ Clear error messages for debugging  
✅ Continues processing other properties if one fails  
✅ Logs detailed information for troubleshooting  

## Common iCal URLs That Work

### Airbnb
```
https://www.airbnb.com/calendar/ical/[LISTING_ID].ics?s=[TOKEN]
```

### VRBO/HomeAway
```
https://www.vrbo.com/icalendar/[PROPERTY_ID].ics
```

### Booking.com
```
https://admin.booking.com/hotel/hoteladmin/ical.html?token=[TOKEN]
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting Network Errors
1. **Check Firebase Functions are deployed**:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Verify the iCal URL is accessible**:
   - Try opening the URL in a browser
   - Should download an .ics file

3. **Check Firebase Function logs**:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log
   ```

### If Jobs Aren't Created
1. **Verify future dates**: Only future checkout dates create jobs
2. **Check for blocked dates**: Airbnb "Blocked" dates are skipped
3. **Look for duplicates**: System won't create duplicate jobs for same date/property

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `src/icalService.ts` - Main iCal service with retry logic and field handling
2. `functions/index.ts` - Firebase Function with proper field validation

### Key Functions
- `fetchAndParseICal()` - Fetches and parses iCal with retry logic
- `createCleaningJobsFromEvents()` - Creates cleaning jobs with proper field handling
- `parseAirbnbDescription()` - Extracts Airbnb-specific data from DESCRIPTION field

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more booking platforms
- Implement webhook support for real-time updates
- Add configurable cleaning time preferences
- Support for recurring cleaning schedules
