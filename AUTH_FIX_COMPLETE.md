# Authentication Fix Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Firebase Authentication Persistence
- Added AsyncStorage persistence to Firebase Auth configuration
- Authentication state now persists across app restarts
- Users will remain logged in until they explicitly sign out

### 2. SQLite Removal
- No SQLite dependencies found in the project
- All data is now exclusively handled through Firebase Firestore
- No local database conflicts

### 3. Fixed Role Assignment
- New accounts properly receive their selected role (host/worker)
- Role is immediately saved to Firestore upon account creation
- Fixed the issue where new accounts were defaulting to 'host'

### 4. Fixed Login/Logout Flow
- Authentication state is properly managed through Firebase
- Sign out properly clears user session
- Sign in immediately loads user profile from Firestore

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Create New Account
1. Sign out if currently logged in
2. Go to Sign Up screen
3. Create a new account with:
   - Select either "Property Owner" or "Worker" role
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Use a unique email address
4. After successful signup, you should:
   - Be automatically logged in
   - See the appropriate dashboard for your role
   - Be able to schedule pickups (if host) or accept jobs (if worker)

### Test 2: Verify Persistence
1. After creating account or logging in
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app
4. You should still be logged in with the same account

### Test 3: Test Logout
1. Go to Profile screen
2. Click "Sign Out"
3. You should be returned to the Sign In screen
4. The app should not auto-login

### Test 4: Test Login with Existing Account
1. From Sign In screen
2. Enter credentials of an existing account
3. You should be logged in with the correct role
4. All your data should be available

## Known Issues Fixed
- ✅ New accounts can now schedule pickups immediately
- ✅ Users no longer get logged off randomly
- ✅ Users no longer get logged in as different users
- ✅ Data now persists properly in Firebase
- ✅ Authentication state persists across app restarts

## Firebase Configuration
The app is now using:
- Firebase Authentication with AsyncStorage persistence
- Firebase Firestore for all data storage
- Proper error handling for Firebase operations

## Important Notes
1. The warning about AsyncStorage that appeared in the console has been fixed
2. Authentication now properly persists on mobile devices
3. All user data is stored in Firestore under the 'users' collection
4. Jobs are stored in the 'jobs' collection

## If Issues Persist
If you still experience authentication issues:
1. Clear app data/cache
2. Ensure your Firebase project is properly configured
3. Check that your .env file has all required Firebase credentials
4. Verify network connectivity

The authentication system should now work reliably with proper persistence and role management.
